 (MnG) Match and Growth: Study for Children with Down Syndrome Disease

Introduction
	Down Syndrome is one of the genetic disorders that often occur in children. This underdevelopment of physical and mental growth is caused by abnormalities in the development of chromosome 21 which have an impact on physical and mental barriers so that they experience intellectual developmental barriers and difficulty in adapting to the environment in everyday life. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that there are 8 million Down Syndrome sufferers worldwide with an estimated incidence of 1: 1,000 a per birth or around 3,000 to 5,000 childbirths in the world experiencing this condition. Down Syndrome can cause growth delays, disabilities, physical weakness, and decreased IQ in children (Mulia, 2013). These delays and weaknesses make special treatment for children with down syndrome, which is in the learning process that is different from normal children.	 People with Down Syndrome have cognitive limitations that make them experience communication disorders, concentration, ability to carry out tasks, memory, motor development, and body control (Irwanto, 2019). Some symptoms of the down syndrome can be seen during the growth phase in children such as differences in physical condition when infants. this is supported by Marta (2017) explaining that a child with a mental disability is characterized by weak motor control, lack of ability to coordinate, but on the other hand, he can still be trained to achieve abilities to the normal point.  The learning process especially cognitive aspects of thinking such as remembering, understanding, arousing, distinguishing, discovering, and applying the meaning contained in learning are very difficult for children to descend syndrome. With cognitive abilities in this down syndrome children are seen as individuals who actively build their own knowledge of the world. Cognitive development is one of human development related to knowledge, all psychological processes related to how individuals study and think about the environment. According to Darsinah (2011), it states that cognitive how children adapt and interpret objects and events around them.
According to previous research Marta (2017), the use of puzzle methods can improve the cognition of children where students will find learning more enjoyable, so as to foster their learning motivation especially students with down syndrome. besides that through the color card method by Kusumawati (2013). however, there is no touch on the technology being carried out. To overcome this, they must be able to prepare media/aids so that they can receive and can understand and use simple examples and be done with the media.
Based on the above problem we make a product (MnG): Match and Grow. (MnG): This Match and Grow consists of AR (Augmented Reality) applications and other electronic tools with smartphone support. The purpose of this product is to help children with down syndrome in cognitive improvement in learning. The hope can be to provide children with knowledge of down syndrome in increasing knowledge.

Literature Studies
Down Syndrome
Down syndrome is a genetic relief that occurs in the world including Indonesia. This disorder can also be called a trisomy genetic disorder which means an increase in chromosomes in a person, precisely on chromosome 21. These increased chromosomes cause an increase in the amount of protein thereby disrupting a person's physical growth and brain development. As a result, someone who has this disorder has a different appearance from people in general and also different learning abilities. Here is a picture of a cell in someone who has a disorder down syndrome.
Children with down syndrome are estimated to be between 800-1000 births in the world. Furthermore, WHO explained that there are 8 million Down Syndrome sufferers worldwide with an estimated incidence of 1: 1,000 per birth or around 3,000 to 5,000 childbirths in the world. Down syndrome is not a disease then it is not contagious, because it has happened since it was in the womb. His daily activities of children with down syndrome require educational services such as self-development programs. Generally, Down syndrome children of school age still experience delays in motor skills, where interference often occurs one of them is writing ability (Arianti, 2018). Down syndrome children at this age still have difficulty coordinating between the eyes and hands and the lack of finger-culp dexterity. This is due to the majority of Down syndrome children having weak muscle strength when compared to normal children (Gunarhadi, 2015).
RFID (Radio Frequency Identification)
	Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is a generic term used to describe a system that emits in the form of identity (typical) sequence number of one person or object wirelessly, using radio waves. The identification process is carried out by an RFID reader and an RFID transponder (RFID tag). RFID tags are attached to an object or object to be identified. Each RFID tag has a unique identification number (ID number) data, so there is no RFID tag that has the same ID number. In general, RFID has two components, the first component, the electronic object that is brought closer to the recognized object. This component is a transponder tag or RFID tag. A second component is a tool that can read the tag, which is named a tag reader. However, to create an RFID-based system, it is not enough to only consist of these two components but requires an application or software that functions as a working data processing element of both RFID components.
Augmented Reality
Augmented Reality is an application of a combination of real-world and cyberspace that can be both 2D and 3D projects at the same time. The term AR is often also referred to as tethered reality. Augmented Reality is often used in making games, successful developer games creating Augmented reality games, it's Xbox. Microsoft and Xbox game developers are trying to create new innovations such as Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality. Unfortunately, the implementation of Augmented Reality in Indonesia is still classified as lacking, one of the causes is the lack of knowledge about AR itself both in theory and practice. The use of AR can have a positive impact in various fields, one of which is in the field of education. Augmented Reality implemented in the field of education can be a more enjoyable learning medium and make students more active in the classroom. (Mustaqim.2017)


Conclusion
	The conclusion obtained from is (MnG): Match and Growth is a combination of electron innovation and augmented reality-shaped applications. Tool (MnG): Match and Growth connect Arduino with RFID modules that use radio waves that make up sound according to RFID cards. Application (MnG): Match and Growth in the form of Augmented Reality which displays virtual objects on real objects with 3D shapes and sounds. Usage (MnG): Match and Growth can have a positive impact in various fields, one of which is in the field of education especially children in the down syndrome class.
